This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose 
This recruitment progress tracking is a simple React application allowing me to capture my journey on seeking the next software development job. I build the app in three days from front to back using React, NodeJS, and AWS stacks, including the latest technologies such as EC2, CloudFront, Load Balancer. It might seem like the stack is a little bit too much for such a simple application; however, it is a way for me to practice and review all the technologies and services my team has been using recently. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
